# PreMortem AI

## PreMortem: the AI that stress-tests decisions before you make them

chinmaey> Taglines are useful for slides, 

Every failed project, bad vendor contract, cost overrun, and procurement
disaster had one thing in common:

The warning signs existed before the decision was made.
Someone noticed them.
Nobody acted on them.

Organizations lose billions every year not because they lack data, but because
they make critical decisions under time pressure, hierarchy, optimism bias, and
incomplete information.

PreMortem AI is an **AI decision auditor** that challenges high-stakes decisions
before they happen.

Instead of asking, "Why did this project fail?" six months later, PreMortem
asks:

> "Imagine it's six months from now and this decision has failed
> catastrophically. What went wrong?"

Then it finds the answers automatically.

## How It Works

A procurement team uploads a vendor proposal, purchase order, contract, or
project plan.

Within minutes, PreMortem:

- Identifies hidden contract risks
- Detects unusual payment terms
- Compares pricing against market benchmarks
- Pulls live vendor intelligence from public sources
- Cross-references similar decisions from company history
- Predicts likely failure modes and financial impact
- Generates a Go / No-Go recommendation

## Why This Is Different From ChatGPT

ChatGPT reads the document.

PreMortem reads:

- The document
- Your company's procurement history
- Previous project outcomes
- Vendor performance records
- Market data
- Public litigation and risk signals

It doesn't give generic advice.

It tells you:

- "The last three projects using vendors with these payment terms averaged 34%
  cost overruns."
- "This vendor has ongoing litigation that may impact delivery."
- "The warranty excludes the most common failure mode for this equipment
  category."
- "Expected financial exposure: ₹2.4 Crore."

chinmaey> Competitive claims should stay cautious unless we have strong evidence
or validated technical differentiation.

chinmaey> Approval-gate failure prevention is a strong positioning, while
existing procurement platforms can be described as primarily workflow focused.

## The Holy-Shit Moment

A hospital procurement team uploads a ₹20 Crore medical equipment proposal.

Thirty seconds later:

**Risk Score: 73/100**

**Top Findings**

- 70% upfront payment requested (industry average: 30%)
- Warranty excludes electrical failures
- Vendor involved in recent supply-chain disruption
- Similar contracts historically produced 28-42% budget overruns

**Recommendation:** Renegotiate before approval.

One upload. One report. Potentially millions saved.

## Why It Matters

Most AI tools help people work faster. PreMortem helps organizations avoid
making the wrong decision in the first place.

The cost of one bad decision often exceeds the cost of thousands of good ones.

We are building the AI that sits in the room and asks the question nobody else
is willing to ask.

Before you sign. Before you approve. Before you commit.

PreMortem tells you what future-you wishes someone had said.

chinmaey> The "human touch" positioning should remain. Human involvement should
feel like governance and judgment, not a dependency or limitation.

## Which Industry Should I have Resonating Focus on?

> "We evaluated 4 industries across 5 parameters. Construction has the biggest
> market but decisions take months and involve politicians — an AI agent can't
> intercept that cleanly. Corporate is too diffuse. Pharma is regulated but
> complex to deploy in a hackathon. Hospital procurement scores 44/50 — and
> here's why it wins: the error is not just expensive, it's fatal. India records
> 5.2 million medical errors a year. The procurement decision that ordered the
> wrong equipment or skipped a contract clause is the upstream cause. The
> decision moment is a single purchase order — discrete, documented, and
> requiring sign-off. That's exactly where PreMortem sits."

chinmaey> Audience-specific framing is useful. Judges, investors, and government
RFP reviewers may each need a different version of the same story.

                                                  ├─ Financial Exposure Agent
                                                  ├─ Historical Intelligence Agent  ──► ChromaDB
                                                  ├─ Scenario Simulation Agent
                                                  └─ Decision Board Agent (consolidator)
```

chinmaey> A fixed number of agents should not become the main claim. The stronger
agentic idea is configurable agent selection and future agent discovery.

chinmaey> Decision Board consolidation is an important proof point.

| Layer       | Technology |
|-------------|------------|
| Frontend    | **Streamlit** (Python UI), Plotly |
| Backend     | **FastAPI** |
| Agents      | **OpenAI Agents SDK / GPT-5.5** (with deterministic offline fallback) |
| Workflow    | Parallel orchestration (LangGraph-compatible) |
| Vector DB   | **ChromaDB** + OpenAI embeddings |
| Documents   | **PyPDF**, python-docx |
| Reports     | **ReportLab** (PDF), python-docx (Word), JSON |
| Database    | **PostgreSQL** (via docker-compose) |
| Deployment  | **Docker + Docker Compose** |

chinmaey> OpenAI Agents SDK is useful implementation context, but we should be
clear about what it proves beyond framework usage.

> 💡 **No API key? No problem.** Every agent has a rule-based engine, so the
> full demo runs offline and deterministically. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to switch
> to LLM-authored agentic reasoning automatically.

chinmaey> Docker and offline mode are useful for demo reproducibility, but they
should not be treated as the main differentiator.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Docker (recommended)

```bash
cd premortem-ai
cp .env.example .env          # optionally add OPENAI_API_KEY
docker compose up --build
```

- UI:      http://localhost:8501
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Docker DB from host: `localhost:5433`
- Docker uses pgvector-enabled Postgres, indexes OKF memory on backend startup,
  and stores completed bid decision history in Postgres.
- Optional market research uses OpenAI Responses API `web_search` when
  `MARKET_RESEARCH_ENABLED=1` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured.

In a second terminal, verify the Docker backend is healthy:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Run the bid contract-review integration test against the Docker backend:

```bash
python backend/tests/test_contract_review.py --api http://127.0.0.1:8000 --bid-id BID-001
```

Run the Vendor Proposal Agent helper inside Docker:

```bash
docker compose build backend
docker compose up -d db backend
docker compose exec backend python tests/test_vendor_proposal_agent.py --pdf /files/input/samples/bids/BID-001/BID-001-Q01.pdf
```

Run the RFQ Intake and Negotiation UI Guidance Agent helper inside Docker:

```bash
docker compose build backend
docker compose up -d db backend
docker compose exec backend python tests/test_ui_guidance_agent.py --pdf /files/input/samples/bids/BID-001/BID-001-Q01.pdf
```

This helper prints the agent output and stores `ui_guidance_agent` rows in
`agent_history` / `agent_history_chunks`. It does not create a `RUN-XXX`
directory because it does not call the bid orchestrator or artifact store. Use
`--no-store` to print output only.

Run the RFQ Intake and Negotiation UI Guidance API test using a completed
Vendor Proposal Agent artifact:

```bash
docker compose exec backend python tests/test_ui_guidance_api.py --artifact /files/output/bid_runs/RUN-024/vendor_proposal_agent_quote_intelligence.json --api http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Run the full bid-evaluation unittest inside Docker:

```bash
docker compose exec backend env RUN_BID_EVAL_TESTS=1 BID_ID=BID-001 MAX_QUOTES_PER_BID=1 python -m unittest tests.test_bid_evaluation
```

The full bid-evaluation unittest creates a new `files/output/bid_runs/RUN-XXX`
directory and writes run artifacts.

Inspect the newest vendor proposal artifact:

```bash
ls -td files/output/bid_runs/RUN-* | head -1
cat files/output/bid_runs/RUN-XXX/vendor_proposal_agent_quote_intelligence.json
```

Replace `RUN-XXX` with the newest run id. Rebuild the backend image after code
or test-helper changes because Docker copies `backend/app`, `backend/tests`, and
`backend/agent_profiles` at build time.

Check pgvector/Postgres tables inside Docker:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U premortem -d premortem -c "\dt"
docker compose exec db psql -U premortem -d premortem -c "SELECT count(*) FROM agent_memory_chunks;"
docker compose exec db psql -U premortem -d premortem -c "SELECT count(*) FROM decision_history;"
docker compose exec db psql -U premortem -d premortem -c "SELECT count(*) FROM decision_history_chunks;"
docker compose exec db psql -U premortem -d premortem -c "SELECT agent_id, COUNT(*) AS rows FROM agent_history GROUP BY agent_id ORDER BY agent_id;"
docker compose exec db psql -U premortem -d premortem -c "SELECT agent_id, COUNT(*) AS chunks FROM agent_history_chunks GROUP BY agent_id ORDER BY agent_id;"
```

From the host machine, connect to the Docker database on port `5433`:

```bash
psql "postgresql://premortem:premortem@127.0.0.1:5433/premortem"
```

Do not use host port `5432` for Docker checks unless you changed
`docker-compose.yml`; `5432` may be your local PostgreSQL.

Database URL choices:

```env
# Docker backend -> Docker db
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://premortem:premortem@db:5432/premortem

# Local backend -> Docker db exposed on host port 5433
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://premortem:premortem@127.0.0.1:5433/premortem

# Local backend -> local Postgres on host port 5432
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://premortem:premortem@127.0.0.1:5432/premortem
```

### Option B — Local (two terminals)

**Backend**
```bash
cd premortem-ai/backend
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate                         # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_backend.py
```

For local pgvector-backed OKF memory, install PostgreSQL + pgvector once, then
run:

```bash
cd premortem-ai/backend
python setup_pgvector.py
```

Useful local PostgreSQL checks:

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
pg_lsclusters
sudo ss -ltnp | grep 5432
psql "postgresql://premortem:premortem@localhost:5432/premortem" -c "\dt"
```

On Ubuntu, `postgresql.service` may show `active (exited)` while the actual
cluster is still online. Use `pg_lsclusters` to confirm the cluster status and
port.

Backend HTTP API:

- Base URL: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health check: http://localhost:8000/health

**Frontend**
```bash
cd premortem-ai/frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The backend and frontend load `../.env` automatically for local runs. Values
already exported in your shell or provided by Docker still take precedence. For
local backend runs, keep OKF and pgvector settings centralized in the repository
root `.env`; `backend/run_backend.py` fills in local path defaults and starts
uvicorn.
`OKF_MEMORY_ROOT` enables the contract agent's durable memory bundle during
backend runs. `OKF_WRITE_MEMORY_INDEX=1` writes a plain-text metadata index to
`backend/agent_profiles/contract_agent_profile/contract_agent_memory_index.json`
on backend startup. `OKF_INDEX_PGVECTOR=1` also indexes the same chunks into the
shared `agent_memory_chunks` pgvector table when a pgvector-enabled Postgres is
available. `OKF_USE_PGVECTOR_RETRIEVAL=1` retrieves OKF prompt memory from that
table, with rule-based retrieval as a fallback. If these values are omitted, the
app still runs with the normal offline/LLM fallback behavior.

chinmaey> pgvector memory is useful, but memory alone is not enough. A Quality
Evaluation Agent should help show that memory improves evidence and decisions.

Open http://localhost:8501, click **Load AIIMS MRI demo**, then **Run PreMortem**.

---

## Demo: Expected Output (AIIMS MRI)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall Risk Score | ~88/100 |
| Failure Probability | ~91% |
| Predicted Failure Mode | Equipment delivered before site readiness |
| Recommended Decision | **NO-GO** |

chinmaey> Concrete demo metrics are useful. The AIIMS MRI case, risk score,
failure probability, ₹72 Cr context, and NO-GO recommendation make the story
easier to understand.

**Conditions for approval:** facility readiness ≥95%, approvals completed,
technicians hired, warranty revised to commissioning date.
